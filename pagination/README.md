# pagination

## Description
This directory contains exercises focused on implementing **pagination** in backend applications, as part of the Holberton School Web Back End curriculum. Pagination helps divide large datasets into smaller, manageable “pages” when fetching or displaying results.

## Topics
- Logic for splitting data into pages  
- Handling page numbers and limits  
- Validating query parameters  

## Usage
Follow the instructions in each file to test the pagination logic (usually with Node.js):

```bash
node filename.js
```
